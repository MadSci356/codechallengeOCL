		COURTESY: Hello we are looking for a forever home for Jack Johnson.
		He is neutered and up to date on his shots. His original owner was
		sent to prison and was not very kind to him. His current foster has
		not been able to find him the perfect home. JJ loves his toys and to
		run around and play with his other canine friends. He used to get a
		bit nippy when you towel dry him (the groomer uses a muzzle easily!),
		corner him or touch his food.  The foster started hand feeding him to
		desensitize him and now he will eat out of her hand!!!! We highly
		suspect that is because of how he was previously treated. He simply
		needed a patient person or people to take him under their wing. JJ
		will reward you with puppy kisses!!! He would benefit greatly from
		proper calm training. He turned 5 in December and has been totally
		opening up and blossoming since he has been in foster. He is located
		in Ashboro, NC.  (Note, he is on a tie out so he can run and play,
		because they do not have a fence).
		To meet Jack Johnson, please submit
		an online adoption interest form by clicking, or cut and paste, the
		following link:

	Description: Wallace YouTube Star:
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Zefxv451I&feature=youtu.be 2 year
		old male Raleigh, NC Seeking active companion committed to a lifetime
		relationship. I live with my foster mom. I get along with my canine
		and feline foster siblings. I don't chew on the furniture or eat
		shoes. I love naps as much as I love a good run. I prefer hockey over
		football. Go Canes!!! I am a social, active & comedic pup. I do some
		stunt work. Have you ever seen the movie where the dog lures the bad
		guys through the woods to keep the kids safe? Me too. I love that
		movie. That wasn't me, but my foster mom says I pull some crazy
		stunts. I am also going to school to learn how to be a better Wallace.
		Movies: Cool Hand Luke, The Big Lebowski, Goonies, The Godfather,
		Spaceballs, Anything Mel Brooks, really. Food: I love food. Period.
		Especially peanut butter. It's sooooooo good. Oh, and bacon. Bacon on
		chicken is better. Hamburgers are good too. Need I go on? Hobbies:
		Running, hiking, Tug o' War, Zoomies. On a typical Tuesday night I: Go
		for a good walk followed by dinner. I keep hoping my foster mom will
		finally share her dinner with me. When that doesn't happen I settle in
		with a chew toy and watch some TV. (P.S. I think Tim Allen is funny.)
		The most private thing I am willing to admit: My foster mom's cat
		scared me for the first few weeks. It took me a while to not be
		creeped out by him. Admit it, the way cats skulk about and seem to
		come out of nowhere is just not normal. You should check me out if you
		are: Active, adventurous, patient, into training and like to just have
		fun. Another dog friend is a HUGE plus. I donât think thatâs too
		much to ask. For more information on our adoption process, or to fill
		out an application, please visit

Name: Halee

	Description: Hello! Halee here! You see my smile? Well, that gives a hint at how
		happy I am that I was rescued from that place with all of the cages
		and unhappy barking dogs. They said I wasn't getting out of there
		alive unless someone rescued me. My new friends saved me in the nick
		of time! I don't know what all that really means, but it doesn't sound
		good. I'm sure glad they got me outta there, though! They brought me
		to this place with other dogs, a furry thing they call a cat, lots of
		food and water, these awesome things called toys, and the things that
		took a while to get used to... rules. Since I'm such a sassy
		smartypants, I tried to evade these rules and just do what I wanted
		but mom wouldn't let me. Turns out that she had the right idea! She
		gives me treats and lovin' when I do things like sit, lay down, come,
		and wait. Wait is my favorite! It's hard work to have those delicious
		cookies right in front of my nose and not gobble them up, but mom is
		so happy when I wait til she tells me ok! I kinda like that lady! I
		have a cat and two other pups like me in the house. We do stuff
		together like patiently wait for mom to get out dinner and breakfast
		together, do training stuff, and go out in the yard together. I have a
		lot of energy, so I love working and playing. They look at me kinda
		funny when I play with my toys in the house. I LOVE MY TOYS! It
		doesn't bother me when my fur siblings want to play with them either,
		which mom thinks is great. Oh, and I LOVE FOOD. Mom is teaching me not
		to eat as fast as I can and the proper way to eat off of a spoon like
		a lady. Very important for a lady to have manners. Speaking of
		manners... mom has taught me to resist the temptation to look at what
		is on the counters no matter how good the stuff up there smells. They
		sometimes give me these neat things called Kongs that are filled with
		frozen food when I go in my crate. I don't mind being in there, but
		I'd rather be with my friends. I only whine a bit when I really want
		to hang out with everyone. I'm also trying to not jump on people when
		I first meet them. She also says I'm almost a perfect lady on walks.
		WALKS ARE AWESOME! I even play fetch and bring the ball back to my mom
		so she can throw it again. Mom says I learn best when I'm having fun.
		Otherwise I'm a boogerface. I don't think I have boogers on my face,
		but she knows best! To learn more about our adoption process or to

	Description: Hi I'm Willow! I'm a pint sized ball of energy and love. I'm a little
		skinny now but I should probably be about 45lbs. When I got out of the
		shelter I didn't know very many rules about being a good doggy but
		foster mom is teaching me lots and I've already learned so much! I
		like playing with my foster brother and chasing the ball in the yard.
		When it's rest time I like to chew on a bone or Kong in my crate and
		then stretch out for a good nap. Watch out, I snore! I still have some
		puppy mischief in me but I like to think that just keeps life
		interesting. I like going on walks in the neighborhood and I'm pretty
		good on the leash but would like a family to help me get even better.
		I tested ok with cats at the shelter but foster mom thinks I should be
		in a home with no cats or with one that is savvy with excited dog
		buddies like me. I get very excited about playing with my human
		friends so I would probably be best in a house without small kids. I'm
		a fun little lady who would make a great sidekick! To learn more about

	Description: My name is Blue Bellâ¦sometimes my foster Mom and Dad call me
		âBellyâ because I love to have my belly rubbed. I am also
		affectionately called âThe Blue Queenâ as I prefer to lay on very
		soft things and it does not matter if you are already laying on the
		soft thing or not! I am told I am between 3-5 years old, but a lady
		never reveals her actual age. Some would say that I am a âfull-
		figuredâ girl, but I have had several litters of little ones! I am
		constantly on the treadmill at my foster home, but truth be told I
		only get on it to enable me to see out the window better. I am not
		even a very âhigh maintenanceâ lady as I do not care to have
		manicures and pedicures, but my foster Mom and Dad are working on
		itâ¦.that nail file freaks me out! I love car rides (as long as I can
		see out the window) and anything that smells good that you may have in
		your pocket. I am actually very quiet and only bark when I hear
		something that my foster siblings alert me to (or when it is time for
		dinner). I am told I make cute âpiggy noisesâ when I am sniffing
		something, but I find that a bit embarrassing! I will let you know
		when I have to go outside and I have NEVER made a mess in the house or
		chewed up anything that was not mine. My rope toys are my favorite! I
		love to be petted, talked to and tucked in at night. I would be very
		happy in a house with adults who can spend lots of time with me.

	Description: My name is Holly. I am ruff-ly 4 years old. I love to run, and chase
		balls and squirrels. I am a love bug and will take as much affection
		as you are willing to dish out. I am house broken, but I have to stay
		in a crate when you aren't home or when there are a lot of new people
		at my house, because I get a little stressed out. I like my crate and
		will gladly run and get in my crate when you tell me to. I don't have
		a fence in my backyard, but that's okay. I am super obedient and
		learned my boundaries quickly. I don't even go outside them when a
		squirrel comes around. I like to meet other dogs, and live with an
		American Bully that is old let's me aggrevate her. Oh, and I even like
		cats. I would not do well with a young dog that is not well trained.
		My foster mom thinks I would be a good agility dog because I am so
		smart and trainable. I love love love to ride in the car...in fact,
		every time you put your shoes on I will expect you to take me to
		Biscuitville for a dog biscuit. I am very well-behaved when I am in
		the car and the people in the drive-thru think I am so pretty. I would
		be best in a home with no children or older children and I am used to
		having my parents home all day, so that would make me super happy. TO

	Description: Hi, Iâm Nova. I'm 2 and half years old and weigh about 60 pounds.
		I'm looking for a loving family to adopt me forever. I'd love a home
		with a backyard where I can zoom around and play with sticks! I'm very
		sweet and cuddling on the couch for hours on end is one of my all time
		favorite things. I am smart and trainable and will work for treats. I
		am also crate trained and potty trained, but I may have some
		separation anxiety at first when my humans put me in the crate. But
		don't worry, it will get better. I love walks and I promise not to
		pull on the leash much if I have a proper harness on. I'm good at
		riding in the car and I love looking out the car windows. Sometimes I
		even try to worm my way into the front passenger seat - everyone needs
		a co-pilot right!?! I do well with kids but I can be clumsy and
		headstrong from time to time. I would thrive with a strong assertive
		leader who can guide me through a proper decompression period,
		decompression is best and it really will help me settle in nicely to
		your home! Since I did not receive a lot of socialization at a young
		age, I would really benefit from some exposure to friendly dogs. I
		don't trust cats - do you blame me?! I love my foster family but I
		know that there is a home out there that is a better fit for me. I
		hope it's yours! To learn more about our adoption process or to fill

	Description: Hi! My name is Kimmie---I am about 3 years old, weigh about 45 lbs,
		and look a lot like the dog on the MPBF webpage! I am shiny black with
		a white stomach and white on my paws like socks! I used to be at the
		Guilford Animal Shelter until I was rescued in December 2017, and have
		been a much happier dog ever since! I now live at a foster home, and
		get to run around in the yard where I love to spend hours chasing
		squirrels, and get to go for long walks on the trails around Lake
		Brandt, which is the highlight of the day! I am all muscle, and love
		lots of walks to keep in shape! I love mealtimes and all dog treats! I

	Description: Hello, my name is Hercules! I am a goofy, smart, sweet boy that LOVES
		hoomans! Iâll even prove it by giving you tons of kisses. Smiling
		and snuggling are my favorite. Iâm just a love machine! Iâm almost
		3 years old and I weigh about 75 lbs. I love having a job and using my
		smarts! Iâm really good at getting frozen goodness out of a Kong or
		this thing called âsnufflingâ when my hooman throws a handful of
		kibble in the backyard for me to find. Bonus, I will protect you from
		squirrels! I get a little overwhelmed when Iâm in new environments
		so Iâm looking for more of a homebody lifestyle. Iâm always down
		for a car ride! The best rides are the ones where I help my hooman
		âorderâ and then these nice people give you the delicious smelling
		treats from the window. Iâm good in my crate and like having a space
		to call my own. I even trained my hooman to give me some treats in my
		Kong to go in! I didnât get the best start and when I came to my
		hooman we had some catching up to do, but we went to training and
		Iâve learned my manners! Iâm very smart and figure out what you
		want me to do quickly, especially when there is a treat involved in
		the deal. I thought I found the perfect home, but you see, I really
		want to be the only dog and the other guy wouldnât move out. My
		hooman thinks I didnât interact with many dogs when I was young so
		am not quite sure how to read them. If you are looking for a one and
		only, Iâm your guy! To learn more about our adoption process or to

	Description: My name is Brownie and Iâve been told Iâm a senior but at 9 I
		still act like puppy sometimes. I love to unstuff my toys but I go in
		the backyard to do it so I donât make a mess in the house. Iâm so
		smart. I love rolling around outside in the sunshine and sometimes I
		roll in tree sap and mom gives me a bath every time. I donât know
		why she doesnât like me sticky. I do great in my crate and rarely
		bark. I do like to sing some but only when my foster siblings are
		barking. I like other dogs big and small but Iâm more comfortable
		with dogs my size or smaller. I love riding in the car and going to
		work with my foster mom. I like kids but sometimes I kiss little kids
		till they fall over. Not my fault they always smell like food. I walk
		great on a leash and enjoy doing anything outside. If I sound like
		your kinda girl please contact my family at MPBF. To learn more about

	Description: My name is Bruce. I have thoroughly mastered the sad puppy eyes, even
		though my foster parents don't give in to them. Not their first rodeo,
		I guess. You ever seen a brindle coat nicer than mine? Ever since my
		fur started coming back, it's hard not to look at it! I have never had
		an accident in the house! I like to be out and about though, so don't
		be stingy with the trips outside! I also love something to knead and
		chew, so I come with my own lovey! (I'll admit it...I stole foster
		dads old robe and I sleep with it) I follow other dogs really well.
		They obviously have a routine, I learn quickly...sounds like the
		makings a good relationship to me! I like to think I'm cuddly. I like
		children. I play with my foster sister (I told you I like other dogs!)
		all the time and I don't chase squirrels. Or cats for that matter. You
		should call me up sometime. I promise we'll have fun and I bet you'll
		even want to take me home! To learn more about our adoption process or

	Description: So my foster mom calls me âBâ for Brunoâ¦but she says it also
		stands for BULLETPROOF!! Recently a not so fun thing happened to me. A
		loud bang, the smell of gunpowder and a car ride laterâ¦I woke up in
		a hospital with lots and lots of people around me. Even though I was
		in pain, I was the perfect gentleman, or so they said. I went back to
		sleep for a couple hours and woke up missing a legâ¦whatever thatâs
		about. Some very nice people from Merit picked me up and I havenât
		looked back since!! I live in this thing they call a houseâ¦who knew
		perfect pups like me were allowed inside!! And on top of that, I have
		two fur siblings and a human one too. I spend all my time being as
		close to them as they will let meâ¦I guess lying on heads is
		unacceptable. I am still learning my manners and figuring out personal
		spaceâ¦which, without a doubt, is my least favorite rule! I still go
		potty and get to spend plenty of time outdoors which I thoroughly
		enjoy!! I didnât spend a lot of time with people before my new home,
		so new people still make me nervous but we are working on that!! Now
		that Iâm all healed up, weekly trips to grandmas and the awesome
		stores with all the toys and food are in order!! I love my foster
		family but I know that there is a home out there made for me!! Think
		that may be with you?!?! I think so too!!!! To learn more about our

	Description: Let me introduce myself. My name is Cash and I'm new to the Merit
		family. I just got to my foster home and I have a lot to learn. I'm
		about 2 years old and weigh in as a lightweight currently. We are
		working on getting some weight on my bones and my foster mom says I
		have handsome bones I'll have you know it. I'm not use to being able
		to live in the house so I have a bunch of house rules to learn but mom
		says I'm doing a great job. So far I have succeeded at waiting for mom
		to put my food down, laying outside of the kitchen when foster mom is
		cooking, I can still see her. I am crate trained, house broken, know
		my "sit" command and love green beans. I have been working hard at all
		my other commands and I'm making progress. I have two foster sister's
		and a 5 month old cousin who I'm learning to play with and I'm very
		gentle with her. I have to learn to play with my sister's but I LOVE
		playing with the Chuck It ball. I will play all by myself if I have
		too. My foster family is still learning special things about me but
		foster mom wanted to show everyone my handsome face. To learn more

	Description: Hi! I'm Colby. I am a three year old staffy girl . I have short, silky
		tan fur and eyes that match perfectly. I am quite petite (35lbs.) but
		I am muscular and energetic. I love to play fetch and I am super fast
		and athletic. I also play a mean game of tug! I will keep you giggling
		for hours with my antics. I am a little nervous in new places so if
		you had a back yard in which we could play, that would be great. I
		walk very nicely on a leash as long as other people and dogs don't get
		too close. I am gaining more confidence but I still feel safer when
		they are a little farther away. I like to play with other dogs but I
		need some time to get to know them first. It's the same with people. I
		need a little time to make sure they are cool and then I will love all
		over them! Indoors I am quiet and sweet and I settle down quickly. My
		favorite thing is to sleep snuggled up against my person. I am super
		affectionate and it doesn't take me long to make friends. I like to go
		into my crate when I need a rest and I never go to the bathroom in the
		house. I only chew the things that I am supposed to chew. I know lots
		of commands and will do what you ask me to do. I am smart enough to
		figure stuff out quickly and have trained my foster well. I will do
		ANYTHING for a treat. My perfect home would be a quiet environment
		with active people who would like to play with me some every day
		preferably in a fenced yard. Although I like to play outside I don't
		need tons of exercise to be happy. I can be left alone in my crate for
		several hours but I don't think I'd like to be in it for the entire
		day. I'm not really comfortable around small children or cats so a
		home without those would be best for me. I am definitely a "best
		friend" doggy and I am looking for that person or persons who will be
		a best friend back to me. To learn more about our adoption process or
