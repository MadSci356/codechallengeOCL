Name: Brownie
	Age: Adult
	Sex: F
	Photo: <UNKNOWN>
	Description: Are your favorite desserts made of chocolate gooey-ness?  How about
		nice and warm brownies with ice cream on top?  If you have a sweet
		tooth then you should definitely adopt me - Brownie!  I know what
		you are thinking, how can bunnies be companions?  Well for starters,
		even though I enjoy a large enclosure I prefer to spend the majority
		of my time running around and exploring.  I like to play hide-n-
		seek, dash through tunnels and over hurdles, and even toss around a
		few wooden toys.  When I'm tuckered out from my exercise, I enjoy
		gnawing on some cardboard puzzles that are filled with timothy hay.
		I may even be in the mood for a nice salad filled with lettuce,
		blueberries and cilantro.  I hope you would join me!  That way, we
		can stretch out on the floor afterwards for some scratches behind
		the ears and some Netflix.  See?!  Doesn't it sound like fun?  Now
		all you have to do is adopt me and take me home! *I am currently
		living in a foster home and have a rather complicated medical
		history- please ask about meeting me.*  ~My adoption fee is $35.00
		and I do not come with an enclosure.~ How did I get here?
		Transferred from the Wake County Animal Center.

	Description: Milo Rocket is a sweet and gentle 1 year old Lionhead rabbit. Milo is
		both so adventurous and relaxed that he has been know to sit among
		his foster's four cats in the middle of the living room! He will
		even play chase at times!

Milo enjoys roaming around in a bunny
		proofed area, when you're there to  supervise, to get his exercise
		and he is also litter box trained.
Milo is a good eater and runs to
		his food bowl when itâs time for his pellets, especially when
		there are a couple of raisins or chunks of apple in his bowl.
Milo
		is not really a snuggler or a lap-bunny, but he does love a gentle
		nose rub and gives happy binkies and jumps when sees his people
		finally at home. He is a sweet little guy who needs an equally sweet
		family that he can trust and love.If you are interested in adopting
		Milo, please go to our website (www.newmoonrefuge.com) and submit
		our Rabbit application for approval. Thanks!

	Description: ********COURTESY LISTING IF INTERESTED IN GEM PLEASE CONTACT ROODY -
		mothers.helper.inc@gmail.com **********
Hi, I'm Gem! My current
		caretaker calls me that because I am a perfect little Gemini and an
		absolute gem of a bun. I am a fearless explorer who loves evening
		snuggles. I may have been a cat in a former life because I love to
		perch myself on my caretakers desk, sleep on a cat bed in a cat
		tent, and chew/play with scratching posts. I'm also litterbox
		trained and spayed! At the end of the day I like to hop the bed and
		snuggle my face into yours. Cheek pets are my favorite and if you
		are kind enough to do them, ill return the favor by grooming you
		back-trust me your hair looks better after and it's my best way to
		say, "I love you".
I am really into companionship and with the
		right introduction, I would probably really enjoy a bun friend,
		otherwise i am fine with toys and sweet love from you!
Right now I
		am mostly free roam. Which means I stay in my caretaker's room and I
		play in other rooms with them when they get home. It's ok if I stay
		in a pen at first or during work hours but it's really important
		that i get lots of time to romp & hop about!
If you want to learn
		more. Please give me caretaker a shout, they'd be happy to tell you
		more!

Egg loves to
		run around and explore the world. She often leaps onto the couch
		just so she can jump back down. Though she likes to eat, she isnât
		particularly motivated by food. Itâs Eggâs intense curiosity for
		the world around her that keeps her going. Her favorite activity is
		digging in the dirt, but a close second is snuggling with her
		sister. Itâs not easy to convince her to be picked up, but she
		loves the adventures she goes on once sheâs out of her pen.
		Favorite foods include greens, bananas, and carrots. Must be adopted
		with her sister, Worm!

Worm is a quiet rabbit with big plans.
		Sheâs got a great appetite and will eat anything thatâs put in
		front of her. Favorite foods include greens, bananas, carrots, and a
		stolen piece of whatever is on her personâs plate. A leader of the
		pack, she knows what she wants and sheâs not afraid to take it. In
		addition to being a world dominator, she loves her sister and loves
		to sleep peacefully next to her all day and night. Does NOT like
