		(Marble) Tabby with White Gender: Male Adoption Fee: $110.00
		Maximus, aka Max, is a very sweet, handsome, and large boy.  He
		loves attention, playing, and looking out the window from high
		places. He is extremely high energy and needs a home ready for that.
		Max may be too much for some submissive cats. With gradual
		introductions, he has learned to get along with some cats, and even
		cuddles with them, if they let him. Max would do well with another
		large, energetic playmate who wonât back down if Max comes on
		strong.   To introduce Max to other cats and set boundaries, he will
		need a room of his own for a few weeks, with gradually increasing
		supervised freedom. To set clear boundaries and rules, Max has
		learned that a couple of hours time-out alone in his room means he
		broke the rules, and heâs smart enough to figure out what rule he
		broke (each time) after a couple of immediate time-outs. But he may
		sing you the jailhouse blues. Max doesnât seem to like dogs very
		much and would do better in a home without dogs. He even threatened
		a picture of a dog once at the vetâs office!  Max came to us from
		a Good Samaritan in rural North Carolina.   Fully vetted: tested for
		FeLV/FIV (negative unless otherwise noted); treated for intestinal
		parasites, fleas, and ear mites; FVRCP+FeLV vaccinated (initial
		vaccination and booster); and rabies vaccinated; spayed/neutered;
		microchipped with Home Again microchips with rescue paid

		Blue Mix Gender: Male  Tahji is a strikingly handsome guy that was

		do fine with an experienced female cat owner as well. Tahji is
		sensitive to his environment and would do best in a calmer house
		with no children under 10 so he can establish a routine.
		Unfortunately, this is also the reason he gets stressed at adoption
		events and does not do well. Due to this he will need an adjustment
		period of a few days after he is adopted, but once he settles in he
		will be a great cat. Wet food definitely helps him in almost any
		situation! Tahji does well with foster momâs two large dogs, two
		cats and two teenagers. He may "annoy" a cat that does not want to
		play, but generally gets along well with other cats.  Clearly as a
		kitten he was played rough with and was used to âhand
		wrestlingâ. This is something weâve been working on.
		Fortunately, he does not use his claws! Tahji still gets frisky in
		the evening and will need to release some of that energy with
		playing. Other times, if you are chilling on the couch then he will
		join you and often will crawl on your chest with a quiet purr. He is
		always very social, will follow his humans everywhere and has a full
		vocabulary of trills and chirps to talk with! Tahji is always ready
		to join in the bathroom for a drink from the sink or bathtub faucet!

		Now she loves time in her foster dadâs arms or sleeping next to

		does love chasing a laser light, wand toys, and paper balls which
		she will occasionally bring and drop beside her foster dad.  Friday
		will need a little time and extra patience to settle in with her

Gender: Female

Lacerta is an adorable tuxedo with cute little jelly bean toes. She has an almost all black face except for some white on her chin. She is a compact little girl and her foster mom calls Lacerta her âplump little dumplingâ. Lacerta is a very sweet girl, loves attention and being petted, but is still quite independent and is not needy. She likes to sleep with her foster mom â sometimes by her head but usually at the foot of the bed. She likes to hang out with foster mom and help her watch TV or read. When she isnât visiting with her human, she is usually curled up in the top of the cat tree. Lacertaâs favorite toys are catnip toys, but she is not overly playful. She has great litter box and scratching post habits. She is just an all around nice girl.

Lacerta does ok with most cats after proper introductions (it does take her a bit longer to get used to other cats), but does not care for dogs.

Lacerta was born to a stray cat and was adopted from us as a kitten but later returned.

		White Gender: Male  Saturday is a handsome and curious little guy
		with big, beautiful golden eyes. He is very timid and needs some
		extra time to come around. Once he opens up to you and lets you pet
		him, he remembers how much he enjoys affection. When he is happy,
		Saturday makes his long tail dance around. He is an enthusiastic
		pouncer, always on the hunt for toys. He absolutely LOVES the laser
		pointer too! He enjoys the top of the cat tower most, so he can be
		nosey and nap. He shares well with the other cats in the foster home
		and loves to nap on soft blankets or on that piece of clothing you
		put on your bed to wear later. Saturday gets along with other cats
		and doesnât mind being around calm, cat friendly dogs. He would do
		best in a quieter home. Saturday also likes to drink water out of
		the kitchen sink, which not everyone appreciates, so his foster home
		is trying to discourage this. He is a tidy cat with good litterbox
		habits. Saturday is a very sweet boy who just needs someone who is
		patient and will allow him the time to feel comfortable with his
		surroundings.  Saturday and his siblings (Friday, aka Jaws, and

		Marble Tabby Gender: Male  Peppercorn is a magnificently handsome
		and super adorable classic marble tabby. He is a timid boy and shy
		around new people and will hide under furniture â he tends to hide
		low versus hiding high (cat trees, etc.). But once heâs
		comfortable, heâll sneak into bed with you after you fall asleep.
		He doesnât chase toys but he does like âda birdâ toy and will
		come out and run and jump and try to catch it even when visitors are
		present. He is very fond of disemboweling catnip toys so they have
		to be extremely sturdy for them to survive. Peppercorn really likes
		food and cannot be free-fed, or he will gorge himself. He lost 4
		pounds over 1.5 years with controlled feeding. He is currently
		eating Â¼ cup of dry food twice daily. He is not overly fond of
		canned food and he will vocalize when he wants food. Peppercorn has
		been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma in cats is an inflammatory
		condition of the airways; Peppercornâs asthma has been very well
		controlled on a low dose of oral steroids. With very low dose,
		intermittent prednisone, Peppercorn has an excellent quality of life
		and no episodes of coughing or wheezing and would still make a great
		fur kid! The cost of prednisone is less than $20 a month. Peppercorn
		was originally found alone, hungry, and scared alongside of a road
		by someone who was out jogging. He was adopted as a kitten and later
		found as an adult and taken to WCAS who contacted us due to his
		microchip.  Fully vetted: treated for fleas, ear mites, and
