		taniamstafford@gmail.com WITH ANY INTEREST.
		
		Angus was found running
		down Lynn Rd. in duct tape and wire. He was very happy to jump in the
		car and couldn't have been more grateful and sweet. He had a very
		rough beginning, he had parasites, intestinal worms and heart worms.
		We have treated all of these issues as well as neutered and micro
		chipped him and he is now ready to find his forever home.
		
		This guy is
		one big ball of love. His affection for his pack family is strong and
		is balanced by his desire to protect them. He loves to chase: a ball,
		a remote control car, or a possum (he caught one in our back yard).
		The temptation to pursue is just too much to resist! Another dog that
		is laid back and non-aggressive would be an option. He is learning to
		make friends and is doing great but is reactive to aggressiveness in
		other dogs. A family with a cat or another small dog may not be the
		best fit for that reason as he is a large dog.
		
		He is a fast learner
		and has already picked up so many great skills. He is quiet in the
		crate and in general. In the two months he has been with us, I can
		count on one hand the number of times I have heard him bark. He
		sits/stays before every meal, and is learning how to walk nicely on a
		leash. He has a strong desire to please, which makes training so much
		more fun!
		
		Angus has not had much socialization with other dogs, so he
		needs a strong leader with patience to help him figure out how to
		behave properly. He is not the dog for a first time dog owner. He has
		adjusted well to our kids, but it took some time for him to figure out
		the pack order. We think he would fit best in a family with kids over
		the age of 12.
		
		This guy will make an amazing family member, his love
		knows no limits despite the rough start from which he came.

		Hansel is a sweet boy who has
		come far from the day that he was surrendered to our care. He loves
		going for walks in wooded areas, rolling in the grass, and swimming in
		little pools or lakes. This loving dog is great with all animals big
		or small. Morning time is Hanselsâ favorite time of the day. As soon
		as he wakes up he seeks out cuddles and genuinely looks forward to
		saying âgood morningâ to you. Going for a trip to the dog park and
		getting lots of treats are the makings of a perfect day for this
		little man. Hansel is particularly fond of toys that squeak, and
		always sniffs out spare slippers and socks to snuggle in bed with (yes
		he really cuddles with them). He loves sun naps and drags all his toys
		outside to take sun naps with him. This dog would be perfect for an
		outdoor enthusiast who is looking to add another dog to the family.
		Hansel will sleep all day if you let him, but when you bring him
		outside he unleashes all kinds of energy and joy. Due to the the world
		he grew up in, Hansel requires a week or two of patience for him to
		come out of his shell and show his true personality. He grows quite
		attached to whoever he bonds with. New environments are stressful for
		him but he adapts with praise and consistency. Hansel looks to other
		dogs in the home for guidance and confidence so having a doggie
		sibling or two in his adoptive home would be ideal. A calm and loving
		home will be best for our buddy but we think he'll do ok with older,
		quieter children too. Hansel is very attentive to his humans emotions
		and body language and would be an awesome addition to your family!

		Jasper is a good boy who will
		make a great companion for a female adopter. He loves to snuggle on
		the couch and sleep close by at night. Heâs just the right size at
		about 12 lbs....so heâs not too big and not too small. His beautiful
		red color is quite striking. Jasper will make a wonderful companion
		and pet for the right home. He is not compatible with those of the
		male persuasion probably due to an unhappy past experience, however
		heâs done very well in his foster home with his foster mommy and her
		13 year old daughter.

		Are you a hound lover? Well,
		look no further than Bob then. What a lovebug he is. He loves his
		people the most but also likes to hang with his canine friends. Bob
		has come a long way in a year with us. He had a rough life and was in
		pretty bad shape when we brought him into the rescue. After $6000
		worth of surgeries to repair a bad leg and many, many months of
		teaching him basic manners and what it meant to live in a house, Bob
		is like a different dog. Although Bob has many of the typical hound
		tendencies - and if you are a hound lover, you know them all - LOL -
		he's developing into a wonderful dog and companion for adults and
		children alike. Bob will require a fenced yard to make his life near
		perfect. Kids and other dogs might seal the deal :) Did I mention Bob
		LOVES kids?? Loves kids :) Bob deserves a loving home with humans that
		will shower him with love and affection which he no doubt will return
		10 fold. Please submit your application to be considered today!

		Is your dog feeling lonely?
		Does your dog need a companion while youâre away? Are you ok with
		your dogâs companion wanting nothing to do with you? Well, read more
		about Libby â aka your dogâs BFF...Libby came to us from Wake
		County Shelter. She was a stray who was extremely frightened & not
		exposed to much human contact. We were called to help & since rehab is
		part of what we do, we answered the call. Libby is BEYOND sweet, but
		she's also extremely weary of the human world. When sheâs alone with
		the other dogs in her foster home, she's a ânormal,â happy dog â
		bouncing around the yard, rolling, wrestling & running full blast!
		However, as soon as Libby reenters the human realm, her anxiety peaks,
		her tail tucks, & she darts to and from her safe spaces inside the
		house. Libby cannot be leash walked at all, so she MUST be in a home
		with a safe, secure, fully fenced yard. Libby will take treats from
		her foster mom (FM) when in the company of the other pups but is
		otherwise still very timid when approached. Libby recently started
		wagging her tail when she sees FM, which is an ENORMOUS step for her
		â but if FM tries to pet her (even in that tail wagging moment) she
		freezes or darts away.
		Libby will need an extremely understanding &
		patient home with another dog or two. While Libby continues to make
		baby steps, she is still very uncomfortable with human interaction or
		handling. All improvements, which for her are HUGE, for any other dog,
		would seem trivial. Libby may or may not progress to what one would
		expect from a typical family pet. She could adjust in months, years,
		or not at all. Our goal is to place all our adoptable souls with their
		'Pawfect Match' so they can succeed with their Furever Family. Libby
		is a tough/unique case. Libby requires a stable/permanent situation;
		an unsuccessful placement & return to the rescue is simply not an
		option. As much improvement as she's shown with us, she still has
		tremendous lengths to go. Potential adopters must recognize & fully
		accept that Libby may or may not overcome whatever circumstances, or
		lack thereof, prevented her from being completely accepting of humans.
		Libby may simply remain a companion for other dogs.
		If you fully
		understand & can offer all this and more to Libby, submit your
		application.*
		*Serious inquiries only; circumstance requires lengthy
		and vigorous application process.

		Jax is an amazingly sweet

		big enough to play with him. HE CANNOT BE CRATED. In his original

		a punishing way so neither of these things can happen. He loves people
		and other dogs. He is a young dog and is an amazing boy.

		LOOKING FOR A FOSTER FAMILY
		OR ADOPTER. Osha is a 75lb Boxer-Terrier mix who came to our attention
		when she began having her puppies in the shelter a few years ago. We
		swooped in to help this poor mom and ten pups get out of jail so to
		speak and into a loving home. Osha is a sweet dog with a gentle spirit
		who loves walks and curling up on the couch beside you. She is
		wonderful with her humans of all sizes. She doesn't quite realize her
		size so your lap is a comfortable spot even though she's bigger girl!
		Osha decided some time ago that she does not like other dogs which is
		why we are seeking either a foster family or adopter for her with no
		other animals. We expect that she will not care for cats either as she
		can be a little prey driven at times. Osha will do wonderfully in a
		home where she is the queen of her domain. She has done wonderfully
		with children - obviously any dog must be monitored with children as
		she could knock someone down but she loves to give kisses to everyone!
		She is ready for her next adventure with a family to call her own.
		Please consider giving this girl a chance. You will have a sweet and
		loving companion and lifelong best friend.

		Aura is a sweet, shy girl in

		County. She was confiscated by Animal Control as an abuse/neglect

		babies that were starved as well. At 8 weeks old they only weighed 3
		pounds. Thankfully everyone survived - the pups grew and thrived and
		were all adopted. Aura gained weight and has done great in foster
		care. She was heartworm positive at the time of rescue but received
		treatment and is heartworm-free now. Aura's a really great girl and
		deserves a wonderful home of her own. 4/18/19 3:25 PM

		Irene came to us via
		Villalobos Rescue in Louisiana. A hoarder/back yard breeder had a
		house fire and 13 chi mixes perished. Thankfully, Villalobos was able
		to take possession of the remaining 28 dogs. All of the dogs were in
		poor shape when they arrived but have thrived and are well now. Irene
		is a sweet, playful, friendly pup. She loves to be with her people and
		lay on laps and give love. She does get a little jealous when other
		dogs come up and try to get attention from her person when she is on
		their lap. Otherwise, she gets along fine with all the other dogs in
		her foster home. She would likely do best in a home as an only dog/pet
		because of her jealousy. She's a great size and has such a pretty
		black and white coat! If you are looking for a companion and lap dog
		she is your gal!!

		Meet Cooper. Isn't he
		handsome? Yes, all 57 pounds of his smushy gray fur & white-tipped
		tail, paws, and belly. Cooper is housetrained and crate trained - he
		enjoys a treat-filled kong while chilling in his crate. Cooper is a
		smart boy as well - Heâs a graduate of two levels of puppy classes.
		He can sit, leave it, lay down, recall, & is up to a 3 minute stay!
		Cooper can walk on a leash - he loves to explore when walking, & is
		very treat motivated to work on his leash manners. Heâs even working
		hard on maintaining focus on you when other dogs walk by. Cooper lived
		with 10 & 12 year-old boys from the time he was 8 weeks old until he
		was 11 months old and he loved them very much. He enjoys snuggles on
		the couch, & he responds well to requests. He is both active AND chill
		- he still has some puppy energy but likes to lie down beside you as
		well. He loves people & plays a lot. His fetch is coming along nicely
		and he loves to run in the yard. When he is done, heâs exhausted. He
		lets you rub his belly, stroke his ears, & likes to nestle his nose
		into the crook of an elbow or a knee. A DNA test was done in his
		original home which says he is part Labrador, part hound, part Chinese
		Shar Pei, & part American Staffordshire Terrier.
		If heâs so amazing,
		why was is Cooper up for adoption again? With a heavy heart,
		Cooperâs family could no longer keep him. Cooper has been loved &
		cared for since being adopted at 8 weeks of age. He was adopted into a
		home with a 2 year-old dog who was also a Pawfect Match dog. She loved
		him as a puppy, but has gradually indicated that she no longer wants
		another dog to live with her, as she would prefer to be the queen of
		the castle. They both have high energy play styles, & it is not good
		for either of them to be that excited. A few play sessions have been
		too escalated & difficult to break up, with neither dog relenting.
		Cooper liked to initiate play with her & she didn't always comply.
		Cooper didn't take kindly to being told no by her, & continued to
		assert himself. She then didn't take kindly to being ignored. It
		caused a stressful situation for both dogs. Unfortunately, both dogs
		likely need to be singles.
		Cooper needs to know he has a place to be
		calm & that no other dogs might get in his business. He likes to know
		that the people there are his people. Heâs not a great sharer. He
		has played with other mature dogs who are not nervous or anxious & has
		done amazingly well with them in a controlled setting. With another
		timid, reactive, or less confident dog, he is too quick to become a
		bully. He is not a good candidate for a dog park or doggy daycare. It
		would put him an unpredictable situation, undoing the confidence,
		training, & self control that are important to his success. His
		original family worked on calming behaviors & Cooper's confidence &
		kept the dogs separated so that they avoid disagreements until it was
		decided Cooper needed to return to the rescue.
		Cooper is the 'pawfect'
		match for a single dog household looking for a sweet and wonderful,
		housetrained dog with all the puppy basics under control, yet who is
		still young enough to adapt to your lifestyle. Cooper needs a home
		with a fenced yard so that he can burn off the energy he has. Although
		Cooper has received a great deal of training, he will need an adopter
		who will commit to ongoing training. Could You be that 'pawfect'
		match? Could you be the furever home for Cooper?

		Madame G is around 6-7 years
		old. She is a Shepherd mix. She is on the larger size around 60-70
		lbs. She is a very easy dog. She is house-trained, crate trained,
		quiet and walks perfectly on leash. She would be fine in an apartment
		setting and doesnât require a lot of space. She is a very laid back,
		easy going dog. She is non destructive when left unattended. She is a
		bit fearful of storms but is fine as long as she is inside during one.
		She loves belly rubs and is happy to just lay next to your feet. She
		is selective with dogs and will take time to warm up to them. She does
		not like hyper dogs or dogs that want to get in her face. She has not
		been tested with cats. She is current on all vaccines,
		heartworm/flea/tick prevention, spayed and heartworm negative. She
		does require a daily eye drop for dryness that is inexpensive. We will
		provide three bottles to her adopter. She tolerates the drops being
		put in with no problem. She is being fostered in Rocky Mount, NC. If

		has been doing great with all the other dogs of all sizes and ages at

		be very devoted to his person. He probably would do better in a home
		with no children or one with older children because his breed was bred
		to herd cattle so they are nippy...not biting but will nip at your
		heels to try to herd you. Chester doesn't really try to nip at your
		heels at all but he does like to herd the other dogs in his foster
		home. If you are looking for an active side kick who also likes to
		kick back and chill with you then Chester would be your man.We are not
		sure about cats but I would probably say he wouldn't do well with cats
		but would have to cat test him to be sure.

		Mork has all the personality
		of a big dog in a medium-sized package, weighing in at 40 pounds. Mork
		LOVES people, cuddles, tummy rubs, and treats. Heâs somewhat of
		homebody and is most happy at home with his people. He loves to
		snuggle up, sit in a lap and push his head into a full-on hug. Heâs
		definitely a foodie and does great with consistent, treat and praise-
		based training. Mork is housetrained* but may have an occasional slip
		up â as we all do. He does very well in his crate while his humans
		are away. Heâs a smart dog that wants to please and is giving 100%
		of what he can. Mork can be anxious and afraid in new situations, so
		he is a little slow to warm up to new dogs* and new people*, but with
		patience, supervision and gentle correction, he could come around. If
		youâre a dog savvy person who enjoys snuggles, hugs, and staying
		close to home, youâve found your Pawfect Match in this super

		Fritz is a smaller boy who

		dogs in his foster home which range in all sizes and ages. He will do
		much better in a household of at least one other dog to help him get
		over his fear of humans. He likes to be close to where his foster mom
		is and will even sleep in bed but just don't touch me :( I think he
		will come around with time and patience. He has already come a long
		way, the first week in his foster home he wouldn't really leave his
		crate...now he is wherever you are and the other dogs but you still
		can't touch him.If you are looking for a dog that you can help get
		over his fear of humans then Fritz is the dog. It is the most
		rewarding thing you can do to help a dog become confindent and loving
		life.

		come a long way learning to kiss and not play bite.

		Bluebell (aka Keira) is an
		incredibly sweet little lady. She loves to cuddle & will shower you
		with wet kisses all day long if you let her. She has A LOT of energy
		so needs a fenced yard to run, & she has jumps to rival LeBron James
		so a short fence would not do. She loves her walks through the
		neighborhood & those definitely help get that energy out. She is still
		working on learning her commands but knows sit, stay & almost has her
		âpawâ command down. Regular stuffed dog toys are no match for
		herâ¦she will devour those in 30 minutes if you let her. She prefers
		much tougher chew toys and loves a good game of tug of war. Kiera does
		still pull some while on a leash & because of this a harness that goes
		around her chest is recommendedâ¦but one she canât easily get her
		mouth on. She is crate trained & has no issues ridingout the work
		hours in her crate as long as she has room to move around, a
		window(s), some harder chew toys & an oldies radio station to keep her
		companyâ¦a Kong toy of some kind with frozen peanut butter inside is
		by far her favorite to be left with. She also travels in cars well &
		will jump to the front seat and patiently wait for you if left while
		youâre in a store. Keira needs to be the only animal in the home as
		she is the alpha & has no issues making that known. She would be best
		for an owner(s) who can give her 100% of their attention. She does
		love to play with other dogs (cats are hit or miss), but unstructured
		play that is not monitored can lead to negative results. Short play
		sessions that can be monitored are best for her. Keira will need
		patience and ongoing training as most young dogs do. *Note from the
		original adopter* Rehoming Keira was not a snap decision. But after 6
		months it has become obvious her and our other dog of 4 years are not
		fond of each otherâ¦as both want to be the alpha. We also found out
		we are expecting our first child a few months after adopting Keira. If
		we were not expecting our first child we would not be rehoming herâ¦I
		want that to be clear. We debated for several weeks on the best course
		of action for Keira and did consult professionals. But ultimately we
		feel we will not be able to give her the attention she needs because
		of the baby. She does also need professional training and that added
		expense plus the new baby is not something we can afford. So please
		donât look at Keira as a problem dog. She is truly a very fun dog
		and loving dog. Unfortunately she just needs what we canât provide
		herâ¦a lot of attention and some training. She has so much love to
		give and will make a wonderful pet.

		Ebony is a sweet girl who
		loves people and dogs. Her tail is always wagging. We were lucky
		enough to get her when another rescue pulled her from a rural shelter
		but couldnât keep her because she was pregnant. She had her puppies
		recently but they have weaned. She will be spayed soon and then ready
		for her forever. Whoever gets Ebony will have a prize. She is such an
		angel. She is young and very active. She will need lots of exercise
		and preferably a good yard.
